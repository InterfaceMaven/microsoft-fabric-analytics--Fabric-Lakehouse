# What i Did:
- Created a new workspace called it Learn_Workspace
- Create a lakehouse  for my  data files called Learn_Lakehouse

# What i learned:

- Tables in a Microsoft Fabric lakehouse are based on the open source Delta Lake file format, commonly used in Apache Spark.
- We use Files for raw or staged data, and Tables for curated, query-ready datasets. Tables are backed by Delta Lake so they support reliable updates and efficient queries

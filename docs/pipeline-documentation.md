# What i Did:
- Created a new pipline  called it Ingest Data
- Create a lakehouse  for my  data files called Learn_Lakehouse

# What i learned:

- Pipelines provide a guided, repeatable way to bring data into the lakehouse. Theyâ€™re easier than coding from scratch and can be scheduled later if needed.
